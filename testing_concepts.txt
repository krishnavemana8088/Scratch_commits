Test case management tools:



* Why we need test case management tool:

--> To store hows the testing process is done
--> It gives one view for all in the team how the process is going on
--> It removes(minimizes) the duplicate data.



*Advantages:
-> Capturing requirements
-> Designing test cases
-> Creating test execution reports
-> It allows you to create test plans for tracking progress
-> Helps you to measure progress with informative dashboards and activity reports
-> It improves test coverage, as it takes care of requirement management and test case creation and execution.
-> It makes it simple for the team to view all the testing activities in a single application.
-> It consolidates the execution report and gives us visual insights.
-> It minimizes duplication in data.
-> It should give testing managers a platform to plan, divide, organize, and delegate tasks to team members based on their skills and capabilities.
-> A good test management software should provide robust tools to test every component of the testing cycle meticulously.
-> It creates room for testers to run multiple tests on autopilot, thus saving time.
-> Test management software should be flexible to be adapted to the unique demand of each project.



example:



Testpad – Best for finding bugs that matter most
PractiTest – Best for precise results & flexibility
Zephyr Enterprise – Best for speed and constantly improvement
TestRail – Best for manage, track & organizing testing
Xray – Best for quality management
Testmo – Best-in-class reporting, metrics and real-time charts
TestMonitor – Best for Real-time insights
SpiraTest – Best for Parameterized test, test review, and scheduling



Test case design::-



it reefers to how to set up the test cases. test case design is also plays a keyrole in testing if we are not implement the proper design for test case
